# Python Module 06 – Comprehensions

This module is part of a structured Python learning path focused on
writing clear, robust and explainable Python code.

The goal of this module is to master Python comprehensions as an
expressive and readable tool for data transformation.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand list, dict and set comprehensions in depth
- Replace verbose loops with clear transformations
- Balance conciseness with readability
- Recognize when comprehensions improve code clarity
- Explain comprehension logic during review

---

## 🧠 Topics covered

- List comprehensions
- Dictionary comprehensions
- Set comprehensions
- Filtering and transforming data
- Readability vs conciseness

---

## 🧪 Exercises overview

### Exercise 0 – Basic list comprehensions  
**Focus:** Filtering and transforming sequences

### Exercise 1 – Dictionary comprehensions  
**Focus:** Mapping and restructuring data

### Exercise 2 – Set comprehensions  
**Focus:** Deduplication and uniqueness

### Exercise 3 – Realistic data transformations  
**Focus:** Applying comprehensions in practical scenarios

---

## 🧩 Design principles

- One clear transformation per comprehension
- Prefer readability over extreme compactness
- Avoid nested comprehensions when clarity suffers
- Use comprehensions intentionally, not by default
- Learning-oriented solutions aligned with the subject

---

## 🛠️ Technical constraints

- Python 3.10+
- flake8 compliant
- Standard library only
- Clear separation between logic and execution
- Use of `main()` when applicable

---

## 📌 Notes

Comprehensions are powerful but should remain readable.
This module focuses on writing expressive code that can be
easily understood and explained during technical discussions.
